          <strong>Q: What is the stock exchange?</strong>
          <p>
            A: The stock exchange is a marketplace where financial securities
            are bought and sold.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
          <strong>Q: How can I invest in stocks?</strong>
          <p>
            A: To invest in stocks, you need to open a brokerage account and
            start buying shares of companies.

            >Q: How can users authenticate themselves on the stock exchange
            platform?</strong
          >
          <p>
            A: Users can authenticate themselves by creating an account on the
            platform. During registration, they provide necessary details like
            email, username, and password. This information is stored securely
            and used for future logins. Django offers built-in authentication
            mechanisms that simplify the process of user registration, login,
            and account management.

            >Q: How are stocks listed on the platform, and how can users view
            them?</strong
          >
          <p>
            A: Stocks are listed in a database where each entry represents a
            stock. Information about each stock, such as its name, symbol,
            current price, etc., is stored. Users can view available stocks by
            accessing the platform's stock listing page, where they can see a
            comprehensive list of all stocks.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <strong>Q: How do users buy and sell stocks on the platform?</strong>
          <p>
            A: Users can buy and sell stocks by navigating to the stock details
            page and placing orders. To buy a stock, they enter the quantity
            they want and confirm the purchase. Similarly, for selling, they
            choose the stocks they wish to sell and specify the quantity. The
            system handles the transaction, updates the user's portfolio, and
            adjusts their account balance accordingly.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <strong>Q: Can users track their investment portfolios?</strong>
          <p>
            A: Yes, users can track their investment portfolios on the platform.
            The system keeps a record of the stocks they own and their current
            value. Users can view their portfolios, check the current value of
            their investments, and get insights into their overall performance.

            platform?</strong
          >
          <p>
            A: Sensitive financial information, like passwords and transaction
            data, is encrypted and stored securely in the database. Django
            provides secure authentication mechanisms and best practices to
            ensure data privacy. SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is used to encrypt
            data transmitted between the user's browser and the server, adding
            an extra layer of security.

            >Q: Can users get historical data or trends for stocks?</strong
          >
          <p>
            A: Yes, users can access historical data or trends for stocks. The
            system can integrate with financial APIs or databases to provide
            historical stock prices, trends, and other relevant data. Users can
            use this data to make informed decisions about their investments.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <strong>Q: How is real-time data handled on the platform?</strong>
          <p>
            A: Real-time data can be achieved by integrating with financial data
            providers that offer real-time stock market information through
            APIs. The platform continuously fetches and updates stock prices,
            ensuring users have access to the latest and most accurate data for
            making investment choices.

            or using a dedicated support email. The support team will respond to
            their inquiries, provide assistance, and address any issues or
            concerns they may have while using the platform.
